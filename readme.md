# Install OpenCV into a Python Virtual Environment

For those who want to automate the OpenCV compilation process **and** install it into an isolated Python virtual environment.


## Disclaimer

As I am primarily an Ubuntu user, I created this project with Ubuntu strongly in mind (version 17.10 at time of writing). Your mileage may vary depending on your target architecture, OpenCV version, and Python version. Please feel free to create a branch and/ or pull request for other environments.

The script in this repo is a derivation of the installation scripts found at [LearnOpenCV](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv). My modifications are mostly focused on better virtual environment handling.
